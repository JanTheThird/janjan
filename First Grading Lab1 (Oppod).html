    <h1><b>Happiness</b></h1><br>
     <i>by Song by Rex Orange County</i><br>
    [Verse 1] <br>
I'll be the one that stays 'til the end<br>
And I'll be the one that needs you again<br>
And I'll be the one that proposes in a garden of roses<br>
And truly loves you long after our curtain closes<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
But will you still love me when nobody wants me around?<br>
When I turn eighty-one and forget things, will you still be proud?<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
'Cause I am the one that's waited this long<br>
And I am the one that might get it wrong<br>
And I'll be the one that will love you the way I'm supposed to, girl, oh<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
But will you still love me when nobody wants me around, around?<br>
When I turn eighty-one and forget things, will you still be proud?<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
Proud of me and my short list of accomplishments, say<br>
And me and my lack of new news<br>
Me and my selfishness, oh, me and myself<br>
Wish you nothing but a happy new version of you<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Because I<br>
I, mmm<br>
Mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm, yeah<br>
I want you to tell me you find it hard to be yourself<br>
So I can say it's gonna be alright, yeah<br>
And I want you to love me the way you love your family<br>
The way you love to show me what it's like<br>
To be happy<br>
